What does this genetic variant mean for me?,"This specific mutation in the BRCA1 gene, known as c.68_69delAG (or 5382insC), is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer compared to individuals without such mutations.

The American Cancer Society suggests that women who inherit certain harmful changes or ""mutations"" in the Breast Cancer genes are at an especially high lifetime risk of breast and/or ovarian cancers:

Breast Cancer Risk:
- About 72% will get breast cancer by age 80
- Between 60 - 85% if they do not have preventive surgery

Ovarian Cancer Risk: 
- Around 44% will develop ovarian cancer by the time they reach 80 years old.

Why should I share with family my genetic results?,"There are several reasons why sharing your genetic test results with family members can be beneficial:

1. Health Awareness: Genetic information often includes data about potential hereditary health risks. Sharing this information can help relatives become aware of their own risk for certain conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes.

2. Preventive Measures: If a particular gene variant associated with a higher risk of developing a condition is identified in one person's genome, it may also affect other family members who carry the same variant. Knowing this allows them to take preventive measures early on, which might include lifestyle changes, regular screenings, and even medical interventions that could delay or prevent the onset of the disease.

3. Family Planning: For some couples planning to have children, knowing about specific inherited disorders within the family can inform decisions regarding childbearing.

Can only women can carry a BRCA inherited mutation?,"The statement that ""only women can have a BRAC Inherited Mutation"" is incorrect. Both men and women can inherit mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer as well as other types of cancers.

BRCA1 and BRCA3 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins. These proteins help repair damaged DNA and ensure the stability of each cell's genetic material. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either isn't made or doesn't function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.

Specific inherited mutations in BRCA increase the risk for several kinds of cancer, including:

- Breast cancer
- Ovarian cancer (in females)
- Prostate cancer (more commonly observed in males who inherit a BRACA mutation)
- Pancreatic cancer

Can this variant skip a generation?,"Yes, the ability to roll your tongue is known to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This means that only one copy of the gene from either parent can confer the trait upon their offspring. However, it's possible for individuals who carry the recessive allele (do not have the ability) but do inherit the dominant allele, not express the phenotype due to various reasons such as incomplete penetrance or variable expression.

In some cases, if both parents are carriers and neither expresses the phenotypic feature visibly—perhaps due to reduced penetrance—their children might still receive at least one dominant allele responsible for tongue rolling capability. If these carrier parents happen to each pass on their non-dominant alleles instead, they may produce a child without the visible capacity to perform the action; thus, ""skipping"" generations appears when looking solely at expressed traits rather than genetic information.

People who test positive for a genetic mutation are they at risk of losing their health insurance?,"The possibility of individuals with certain genetic predispositions facing discrimination by insurers is a significant concern, especially in the context of life and disability coverage. Historically, it was relatively common for individuals to lose or be denied these types of insurances if testing revealed that they were carriers of specific mutations known to increase disease risks.

However, this practice has largely been curtailed due to legislative interventions designed to protect consumers from genetic discrimination. In 2008, a critical piece of legislation called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) came into effect in the United States. GINA prohibits group health plans and individual health insurance issuers from using an individual's genetic information when making decisions about eligibility, setting premiums, or determining preexisting conditions. It also restricts employers from using genetic information for hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion purposes.

Additionally, other laws such as the Affordable Care Act further bolster protections against discriminatory practices based on medical history which would include the results of genetic tests.

Surveillance and prevention strategies are tailored to monitor these high-risk individuals closely and detect any malignancies at their earliest stages when they may be most treatable.

Surveillance Strategies:
1. Colonoscopy: Regular colonoscopies starting at age 20-25 years, or 2–5 years younger than the youngest case in the family, whichever is earlier. The frequency should be every one to two years.

What are the surveillance and preventions I can take to reduce my risk of cancer or detecting cancer early if I have an MSH2 mutation?,"If you carry a mutation in the MLH1 gene, your doctor may recommend regular screenings for colon cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends that people with this type of genetic mutation start screening at age 25 or ten years before they were diagnosed with Lynch syndrome-related cancers.
There is no way to cure inherited colorectal cancer syndromes like Lynch Syndrome. But there are ways to control them so patients do not develop any more cancers caused by their faulty genes. You should talk to your healthcare provider about how best to manage your condition after diagnosis.

Why do some families with Lynch syndrome have more cases of cancer than others?,"The variation in the number of cancer cases among different families affected by Lynch Syndrome can be attributed to several factors:

1. Genetic Variability: Although all individuals within a family may inherit the same predisposing mutation, other genetic differences between them—such as modifier genes or polymorphisms that influence gene function—can affect their individual risk levels.

2. Environmental Factors and Lifestyle Choices: Diet, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, obesity, exposure to carcinogens (e.g., certain chemicals), and use of oral contraceptives are examples of environmental and lifestyle variables that could modulate an individual's cancer risk independently from their genetic susceptibility due to Lynch Syndrome.

3. Age Factor: Since the probability of developing cancer increases with age, older members of a Lynch syndrome-affected family might show higher rates simply because they've had longer for cancers to develop.

4. Penetrance and Expressivity: Not everyone who carries a pathogenic variant associated with Lynch Syndrome will",Inheritance Patterns,0.6859588623046875,152,152,1099,3.5,19.1,10,15.2,0.029304029304029304,0.3311355311355311,0.7673172950744629,0.8682296276092529,0.814660370349884,True
How might my genetic test results change over time?,"Your genetic makeup, including any variants associated with Alzheimer's disease risk or other conditions, remains stable throughout your life. The interpretation of these results can evolve as new research emerges and our understanding of genetics improves.

Follow-up question 3:
Question: If a family member tests positive for an AD-related gene variant, what should I do next? 
Answer: Genetic counseling is highly recommended in such cases. A counselor can help you understand the implications of this information and discuss potential preventive measures. It may also be helpful to have open discussions within the family about health history.

What is Lynch Syndrome?,"Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colon and rectum. It is caused by mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, which are responsible for fixing errors that occur during DNA replication. When these genes do not function properly due to a mutation, it can lead to increased rates of genetic alterations throughout the genome, contributing to the development of cancer.

People with Lynch syndrome have a significantly higher lifetime risk of developing colorectal carcinoma compared to individuals without this condition. They may also be at greater risk for other types of cancers such as endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, hepatobiliary tract, upper urinary tract, brain, and skin cancers, among others.

The inheritance pattern of Lynch syndrome is autosomal dominant, meaning only one copy of the altered gene, received from either parent, is sufficient to increase the risk for associated cancers",Genetic Variant Interpretation,0.751545786857605,160,160,1060,27.45,16.1,6,26.666666666666668,0.10151515151515152,0.4575757575757576,0.7658043503761292,0.8152868747711182,0.789771318435669,True
